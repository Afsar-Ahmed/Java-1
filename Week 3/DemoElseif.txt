DemoElseif
1. Create a project called DemoElseif
2. Prompt the user to type in two doubles, d1,d2
3. If d1 is greater than d2, printout "d1 is greater thna d2"
4. If d1 is equal to d2, print out "d1 is equal to d2"
5. If d1 is less than d2, print out "d1 is less than d2"
6. Do the above conditions using only if statements
	a.) Which is more efficient
7. Try using the F7 <Step into> debugging function, go through the code.
	a. Test using d1>d2
	b. Which is more efficient? Else if or only ifs
8. To end the debugging session
